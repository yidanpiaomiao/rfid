	First,RMIServer runs in Hadoop cluster and RMIclient runs in local.RMIServer
provides remote methods you can find in CF.java.
	When a RMIClient who acts as data owner, it will first define a "ACT" string and
get a unique clientID. Then try to produce related keys using the "ACT" string. And
then it will run encFun() to get encrypted bytes. Here remember that the keys produced
above is the data 's related ACT keys and the encrypted bytes are stored in database.
	When a RMIClinet who acts as third party, it will first define a "attr_str" and
provide the aimed clientID. Then try to produce decryption keys using "attr_str". And
then it will run decFun() to get decrypted bytes. Here remember that the keys produced
above is the third party's private key(prv) and the decrypted bytes are stored in database.
	When a RMIClient who acts as data owner and want to update the encrypted bytes. It
will first pull encrypted data from database. And then , it is important that the client
need to run updateKeys() to generate new "usk". Finally, the RMIClient can run decFun()
to decrypt the data using the new "usk".
	The last but not the least, RMIServer runs as a trusted service provider.
